redux:

action => {
  type: "",
  payload: "" || {}
}

reducer => function (state, action) {
  do stuff to modify state (state is immutable)
  returns new state
}

store:
create store using reduxTK.configureStore({ reducer: function () {} })

store.getState()

dispatch:
The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch({ type: '' }) and pass in an action object.
think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event"

selectors:
function foo(state) => return value from passed in state
currentValue = foo(store.getState())
